        MANIKIN AND MINIKIN(A BISQUE-PLAY) BY ALFRED KREYMBORG
    </h6>
    <p>

<h6>Manikin</h6>. Well, I'd venture to say, if she'd only stay away some morning----

<h6>Minikin</h6>. That's what I say in my dreams!

<h6>Manikin</h6>. She and her broom----

<h6>Minikin</h6>. Her everlasting broom----

<h6>Manikin</h6>. She wouldn't be sweeping----

<h6>Minikin</h6>. Every corner, every cranny, every crevice----

<h6>Manikin</h6>. And the dust wouldn't move----

<h6>Minikin</h6>. Wouldn't crawl, wouldn't rise, wouldn't fly----

<h6>Manikin</h6>. And cover us all over----

<h6>Minikin</h6>. Like a spider-web--ugh!

<h6>Manikin</h6>. Everlasting dust has been most of our life----

<h6>Minikin</h6>. Everlasting years and years of dust!

<h6>Manikin</h6>. You on your lovely blue gown----

<h6>Minikin</h6>. And you on your manly pink cloak.

<h6>Manikin</h6>. If she didn't sweep, we wouldn't need dusting----

<h6>Minikin</h6>. Nor need taking down, I should say----

<h6>Manikin</h6>. With her stupid, clumsy hands----

<h6>Minikin</h6>. Her crooked, monkey paws----
